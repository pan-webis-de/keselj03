## keselj03 - An Approach to Authorship Attribution

This is a reimplementation of the approach to authorship attribution originally described in

> Vlado Kešelj, Fuchun Peng, Nick Cercone, and Calvin Thomas. [N-gram-based author profiles for authorship attribution](http://web.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/papers/pacling03.pdf). In Proc. of ACL. pp. 255-264, 2003 [[paper](http://web.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/papers/pacling03.pdf)]

It was reimplemented as part of a science reproducibility study alongside [14 other authorship attribution approaches](https://github.com/search?q="Who+wrote+the+web"+user:pan-webis-de). The results of the reproducibility study can be found in

## Usage

To execute the software, install it and make sure all its dependencies are installed as well; then run the software using the following command:

`python keselj03.py -i <path-to-input-data> -o <output-path>`

## Input and Output Formats

The software accepts authorship attribution datasets that are formatted according to the corresponding [PAN shared task on authorship attribution](http://pan.webis.de/tasks.html). A number of [datasets can be found there](http://pan.webis.de/data.html), and all of them are formatted as follows.

In a dataset's `TOP_DIRECTORY`, a `meta-file.json` is found which comprises

  - the language of the texts within (e.g., EN, GR, etc.),
  - the names of the subdirectories that contain texts from candidate authors,
  - the name of the subdirectory that contains texts of unknown authorship, and
  - the name of each file of unknown authorship that is to be attributed to one of the candidate authors.
  
The software accepts as input a path to an inflated dataset's `TOP_DIRECTORY` and starts the authorship attribution process from there. The output in the `OUTPUT_PATH` will be a file `answers.json` formatted as follows:

```json
{
"answers": [
	{"unknown_text": "unknown00001.txt", "author": "candidate00001", "score": 0.8},
	{"unknown_text": "unknown00002.txt", "author": "candidate00002", "score": 0.9}
	]
}
```

where `unknown_text` is the name of an unknown text as per `meta-file.json`, `author` is the name of a candidate author as per `meta-file.json`, and `score` is as real value in the range [0,1] which indicates the software's confidence in its attribution (0 means completely uncertain, 1 means completely sure).

In case the dataset comprises texts of unknown authorship that have not been authored by any of the candidate authors (i.e., open-set authorship attribution), the software may declare that none of the available candidate authors is the author of a given text of unknown authorship by setting `author` to `candidate00000`. For example:

```json
{
"answers": [
	{"unknown_text": "unknown00001.txt", "author": "candidate00001", "score": 0.8},
	{"unknown_text": "unknown00002.txt", "author": "candidate00000", "score": 0.9}
	]
}
```

# How to use this implementation
This code is written in Python 2.7

To run the main program of n_gram.py, both files (jsonhandler.py and n_gram.py) must be stored in the same folder together with a subfolder which is called in the last line of n_gram.py. 

The subfolder must include:
- candidates' trainings set
- set of unknown texts
- meta-file

The results are saved to the json-file out.json in in the subfolder.
